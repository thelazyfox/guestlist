Confirm your spot in the Nightmix party
=========

The Nightmix party is free for engineers, but how do you prove you are an engineer?

Simple, just add yourself to the engineering guest list, which happens to be this github repository.

Instructions
==========

1) Create a file in the `guests/` directory with the name `First_Last`, where First is your first name and Last is your last name.

2) The file should be 2 lines long, with the following format:

    Name: Your Name
    Company: Your employer

3) Submit a pull request to github with your commit.  Once your pull request is approved, your spot is confirmed.

4) Remember: you must *also* register with Eventbrite with the same github username which actually performed the commit.
